# CPSC-60000 Week 1

This is my Week 1 project.  It is based around pottery pieces and includes the price per pound of clay and, for ease, the price of decorations per pound of clay used.

This project uses the Decorator pattern to append (Decorate) additions onto the piece type and clay to give a total cost of the piece without changing anything in the Piece or Clay classes.  This allows a price to be changed per component (IE only one change needed) should a price change occur.
